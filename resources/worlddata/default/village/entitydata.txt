(Scientist)(0)(1)(50)(10)(This is a very specific rock formation, I hypothesize that it was not formed naturally. Therefor I believe it must have been created by some kind of powerful and rational entity or being.)(true)

(Scientist)(0)(1)(52)(13)(Don't believe my partner over there. He only sees what he wants to see. These rocks could have easily been formed by long term erosion.)(true)
(Gal)(0)(1)(13)(28)(This lake is one of my favorites, if you look closely you can sometimes see some bubbles float to the surface. Its very relaxing to watch while doing yoga in the morning I find.)(true)
